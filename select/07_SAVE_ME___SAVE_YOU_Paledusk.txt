Look up the sky
Can you reach there？
There is nothing I can see

But it's not the end
You've never been my friend
Just wanna comprehend
Yet you shook off my hand

Each time I call, you say nothing at all
You make me rise and fall
We've come to far to fuckin' end it now

Again, I trace the invisible wall
To get into the new world

You light the path I should take
Like the moon light in this dark night
The light has gone too

Everything has changed
But I was left behind
I knew nothing
I stood still there empty

Look up the sky
What do you see there?
