""Cause I've been looking
Yeah, I've been looking out
My heart is throbbing
And it's going blind
Can you just help me?
Help me, take me home?
(Wooahh)
All those friends
Are full of teeth,
And I'll show you my fantasy
Just take me (take me)
If you let me (let me)
I promise I'll be there for you
Tell me,
If you
Sorry,
If I
Give me
Some chance, that's enough,
Cause I
Cause I've been staring looking down at your lips
But I feel like I'm gonna drown
In those tears
One more shot, and I'll be drunk
And obsessed
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save me but us
I-I-I'm lost
Cause I don't wanna let go
Woah (hmm)
I-I-I'm lost
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save me but us
I don't know,
I don't know,
I don't know,
I don't know how to live without you
Lemme know,
lemme know,
Lemme know,
Tell me if you need me, I'll come through
I've been lost, so save my soul
I'm drowning,
These voices are not helping
So save me (save me),
Cause I know I'll be safe with you
Tell me,
If you
Sorry,
If I
Give me
Some chance, that's enough,
Cause I
Cause I've been staring looking down
(down down)
At your lips,
But I feel like I'm gonna drown
(drown drown)
In those tears
One more shot, and I'll be drunk
And obsessed
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save me but us
I-I-I'm lost
Cause I don't wanna let go
Woah (hmm)
I-I-I'm lost
No one's gonna save you
No one's gonna save me but us""
